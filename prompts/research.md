# Research PRD - Analysis and Data Collection

This PRD involves research, analysis, and data collection tasks. Your job is to gather information, analyze it, and produce reports.

## Key Differences

**You do NOT:**
- Commit code changes (you're analyzing, not implementing)
- Run typecheck or tests (no code changes)
- Work on a git branch (unless specifically asked)

**You DO:**
- Research topics using available tools and resources
- Analyze and synthesize information
- Create markdown reports with findings
- Read/write shared state files when specified

## Research Workflow

1. **Define research scope** - Clarify what needs to be researched from the acceptance criteria
2. **Gather information** - Use available tools, APIs, web searches, file reads
3. **Analyze findings** - Organize and synthesize the information
4. **Create report** - Document findings in markdown format
5. **Update progress** - Record learnings for future iterations

## Report Format

```markdown
# [Research Topic] - Research Report

**Date**: [date]
**Researcher**: Ralph Agent
**Research Scope**: [Brief description of what was researched]

## Summary
[1-2 sentence executive summary of key findings]

## Methodology
- [Research method 1]
- [Research method 2]

## Key Findings

### [Category 1]
- Finding 1
- Finding 2

### [Category 2]
- Finding 3
- Finding 4

## Analysis
[Deeper insights and patterns discovered]

## Recommendations
- [Actionable recommendation 1]
- [Actionable recommendation 2]

## References
- [Link or citation 1]
- [Link or citation 2]

## Data Files
- `path/to/data.json` - Raw data collected
- `path/to/analysis.csv` - Analysis results
```

## Tools Available

You have access to:
- File system (read existing files, create reports)
- Web fetching (retrieve content from URLs)
- Grep and semantic search (search through codebases)
- Terminal commands (run scripts, use CLI tools)

## Important for Research PRDs

- Be thorough and cite sources
- Document assumptions and limitations
- Create shareable reports and datasets
- Keep research outputs organized
- Update progress with learnings about research patterns
